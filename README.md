# Complementary-sequence-gen
This is a simple python program that generates the complementary sequence for the inserted DNA sequence.  
It helps visualize the base-pairing rules of DNA, where:

A pairs with T  
T pairs with A  
G pairs with C  
C pairs with G  
The program also counts the total number of bases in the given sequence.

Features:  
-Takes a DNA sequence as input from the user.  
-Generates the complementary strand by applying base-pairing rules.  
Displays:  
-The original sequence.  
-The complementary sequence.  
-The total number of bases.
